                    <p class="aboutS" style="font-size: 120%;">The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

                        1) The subarray which is already sorted.
                        2) Remaining subarray which is unsorted.
                        
                        In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.
                        Best, average and worst case time complexity: (n^2) which is independent of distribution of data.

                        Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order. 
                        This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n2) where n is the number of items.

                <p class="aboutS" style="font-size: 120%;">Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides input array in two halves, calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves. The merge() function is used for merging two halves.
                    The merge(arr, l, m, r) is key process that assumes that arr[l..m] and arr[m+1..r] are sorted and merges the two sorted sub-arrays into one.
                    Best, average and worst case time complexity: (N(logN)) which is independent of distribution of data.
